This directory contains binary samples compiled from source code, with non-vulnerable samples located in the good subdirectory and vulnerable samples in the bad subdirectory.
In the good directory, each subdirectory corresponds to a specific vulnerability type and contains all binary samples in the dataset associated with that vulnerability type.
